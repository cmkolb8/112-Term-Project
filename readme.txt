This project is called Solider Survivor and is a 2.5D shooter game. 
You are assigned as either an alien or human and it is your job to 
either protect(if an aliean) or capture(if a human) this new planet
that has been discovered by the humnas. You will build your defense
using blocks (made through raycasting) and hide soldiers on your side.
Once each tean has finished hiding their soldiers, each side will have 
a catapult to launch fireballs to the other side. The first side to kill
all the soldiers wins. 

Run the main.py file in order to launch the app. 

Both PIL as well as pygame must be installed to run the app.
